    <p class="paragraph">
      Before we started our project, we made a commitment that we will improve some of our issues and difficulties with the last project. Our group commitment is commenting on each section, procrastination, and GitHub workflow. That was not easy to make or improve, but each of us helped in the group to make it much more manageable and easier. We all made the comments. Commenting on each section was not to harder to improve, but every time we do a bigger project, we forget minor details, and that makes our lives harder. Let me give you an example. Somebody finishes his project, and everything is going well, but suddenly, the code breaks, and some other people need to fix what broke.

    <p class="paragraph"> Working in a team can achieve solutions more quickly than individuals working alone. The group will always come up with the best solutions rather than single members alone. In a group, there is always more eyes to look, more people and more ideas that make the group strong and useful. When they see the code, they are not able to grapple with certain parts that were broken. They need to check one by one. If a person who wrote the code comments on each section, anybody can easily find the broken code. That is why commenting on each section is very important, so that it will benefit everyone afterwards.
